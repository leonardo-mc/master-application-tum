# Are Data Structures and Algorithms obsolete today in the age of Machine Learning?

## Introduction

Data plays a vital role in today's world. It is the fuel to the engine which keeps the world moving. Now, it is evident that data can come from a wide variety of sources such as customer orders, stock market, medical reports. Data has become very important today, and we also know that it is growing exponentially. This unprecedented growth in required storage and processing capabilities poses a set of challenges in efficiently storing and analyzing data. The use of a variety of data structures and algorithms is needed to solve these problems. However, while moving into the present, one would think that these data structures and algorithms are obsolete as the power of machine learning and artificial intelligence is at their disposal. So, the question is: Are data structures and algorithms obsolete today in the age of Machine Learning?

The current essay intends to explore why today's age —The era of Data Analysis and Computational Optimization— still requires the use of data structures and algorithms.

## Body

Reading the question on the title, the first thing that comes to mind is the power of machine learning algorithms. These algorithms can recognize the most complex patterns in the data, extract hidden information, and predict future trends.

With the onset of new technologies, a sudden rise in machine learning and artificial intelligence applications has become the Life Blood of many innovations that have been developed to address a variety of society, business, and government problems, including medical diagnosis, spam filtering, search engines, and data mining. The reason behind this sudden rise is the power of computing and processing power. With a rise in power, we have seen a rise in the capabilities of our machines. Today, a single processor can perform a thousand operations a second. This improvement has enabled artificial intelligence to reach a point where it can beat a human at Go. As a result, we have moved from computers capable of solving elementary arithmetic problems to computers that can beat a human at a game that requires creativity.

These massive improvements in the capabilities of computers have made us believe that these algorithms are the future. However, these machine learning algorithms do not work in isolation. They need training data to learn the patterns, and the algorithms need to be tuned; this training process is slow and needs considerable amounts of data: the more data, the better the results.

Data is acquired by various means, and its quality is critical. Unreliable data causes ambiguity in the results and is referred to as "noisy data." So, there is a need to detect these noisy data and eliminate them.

However, data does not equal knowledge. To be effectively used in making decisions, data must go through a transformation process that involves the analysis of data to extract insights, patterns, and trends resulting in the development of decision support tools.

Data structures and algorithms are the core of computer science. Computer science without data structures and algorithms is like cooking without ingredients: Just a bunch of abstract words and symbols that describe the process of cooking but no substance. They also form the base of machine learning models and are the building blocks of these new technologies.

The use of data structures is an integral part of any computer program. They are used to store data in memory in an efficient manner so that it is easy to access when needed. The memory in the computer is not unlimited. Therefore, it is essential to use memory efficiently. Data structures also help organize and store data to make it easier to analyze and process. 

Data analysis is converting raw data to information, which then becomes knowledge if interpreted correctly. 

The use of algorithms is also an integral part of any computer program. So, it is essential to get the best algorithms for the task at hand. Algorithms can be defined as procedures that are followed to solve a problem and are of many types. One of the most important algorithms is the sorting algorithm. It is used to sort data in an efficient manner. There are many types of sorting algorithms.

Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that is based on algorithms that change with experience. A machine learning algorithm is one that is designed to adapt to data. In this way, it can get better at tasks that it is supposed to do. The central premise of machine learning is that the more information it has to work from, the better its decisions will become.

The basic idea behind machine learning is that computers can teach themselves to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. For example, the computer would study a large set of data and learn from the information it contains. Using a wide variety of tasks could then improve this learning.

# Conclusion

The question asked in the title is justified. The power of machine learning and its application is immense. The advantages like autonomous learning, real-time data processing, and autonomous decision-making are endless. However, data structures and algorithms cannot be obsolete. They still hold a significant position in computer programming, and they will always be needed.

As businesses process most of this data, it is evident that the volume of data is increasing exponentially, and the time and storage requirements are also increasing, so data structures and algorithms play a crucial role: They are the ones that store and process these large amounts of data. 

Machine learning algorithms are not magic pills. They also need to be trained and tuned. The training and tuning require the use of these large amounts of data and processing power. So, as data is available in large quantities, and the storage is taken care of by the conventional storage systems, we can undoubtedly conclude that we cannot only rely on machine learning and artificial intelligence to solve all of our problems. We still need data structures and algorithms to solve the problem of solving the problem. So they are relevant than ever before.

Now, this does not mean that we should stop exploring new technologies. Quite the opposite: We should explore new technologies for the sake of learning and gaining new perspectives.
