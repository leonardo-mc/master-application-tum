Dear Sir, Madam,

With this letter I would hereby like to express my motivation to study Master degree Programme in Data Science offered by The Technical University of Munich, in Germany.

I strongly believe that Germany would be an excellent destination to pursue a masterâ€™s degree in Data Science and Data Analytics for graduates who have technical or mathematical problem-solving skills because the curriculum is very well-designed and as per industry requirements.

In my opinion a qualifying University degree along with certifications of the basic technology adopted at the industrial level will be the key criteria for me to become a professional data scientist and data analyst. Now, Germany is widely recognized as IT-hub and there is an increasing demand for graduates in Data Analytics. Therefore, I expect to have a lot of career opportunities to improve my expertise in data analytics and data science on this program.

A master degree course in Data Analytics and Data Science would be an excellent learning platform to master business and data understanding. By studying data analytics in Germany, I will be equipped with the required skills that can support me to become professional data scientist and data analyst in the long run. For example, I will be able to solve complex scientific problems and analyse large data sets using a range of theoretical tools.

Because of my education background in computer science, I am good at computing and mathematics in general and I believe the master in data analytics in Germany is the right choice for me. My future career is being a lecturer with data science and data analytics specialization, so if I have the skills that match with industrial requirements, I will be able to create professionals that match to market needs.

Furthermore, I would be happy to spread word of mouth, about my experiences form participation in the program, and possibly attract more qualified candidates in the future.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I am waiting for your response.

Yours faithfully,

Leonardo Malacara Cruz
